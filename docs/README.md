# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains the process documents that define how OctoAcme plans, executes, and continuously improves its projects. Whether you are a new teammate, a stakeholder, or a contributor, these docs serve as the central reference for understanding our project management approach, roles, and practices.

## OctoAcme Project Management Processes Overview

OctoAcme uses a lightweight, evidence-driven approach to project management. The project lifecycle is organized into five stages: **Initiation** (defining the problem statement, stakeholders, and high-level timeline), **Planning** (scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies), **Execution & Tracking** (building, testing, reviewing, and iterating in short cycles), **Release & Deployment** (deploying, verifying, and announcing), and **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** (capturing learnings and converting them into backlog action items). Key principles throughout are iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety.

Roles and personas are clearly defined to ensure accountability at every stage. The **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and cross-team communication. The **Product Manager (PdM)** owns the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and measures outcomes. **Developers** design, implement, and test features while collaborating on design reviews and estimation. **QA/Testing** validates quality and acceptance criteria. **Stakeholders** provide inputs and approvals. These personas are reused consistently across all process docs and Copilot Spaces exercises.

Communication at OctoAcme follows a structured cadence to keep every group informed without creating overhead. The PM and PdM hold a weekly sync, the delivery team runs twice-weekly standups, stakeholders receive monthly updates, and ad-hoc escalations are raised as needed. Risk management follows a simple Register → Assess → Mitigate → Monitor lifecycle, with risks reviewed at each weekly sync. Escalation paths move from the team level to PM, then to Product Lead, then to Sponsor. A single source of truth (project README or release doc) is used for external status communication.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout the lifecycle rather than treated as a final gate. Acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done are established during planning, developers maintain tests alongside code, and QA validates each increment before release. After every sprint, release, or significant milestone the team runs a structured retrospective to identify what went well, what could be improved, and two to three prioritized action items. Improvements are tracked in the project backlog with clear owners and due dates, and their impact is measured to sustain a culture of continuous improvement.
